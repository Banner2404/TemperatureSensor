# TemperatureSensor

This is the iOS part of my hobby IoT connected temperature sensor. The app can display current temperature and history for day or week.   
Technology stack:
* AWS IoT Core - communication
* AWS DynamoDB - data storage
* [Charts](https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts) - chart library
